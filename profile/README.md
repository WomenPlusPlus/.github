# THE CONCEPT
 
deploy(impact) is a hands-on software development program for social good. 

Learn how to develop a product from A to Z following an agile methodology of a product's full life-cycle: from business requirements definition to proof-of-concept together with the product owner.

Running remotely, for a duration of six weeks (part-time), 30-40 participants will form interdisciplinary teams to work on tech projects for social good. Selected solutions can directly benefit a social cause and will be guided in the technical implementation phase.

# PRIORITIZING LEARNING VS. COMPETITION

## :warning: **Important** 
You will find all the info yiu need for this year program, at [this link](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/.github/wiki)

The main focus of deploy(impact) is to give participants the opportunity to gain real-life experience in the full life cycle of software development projects in a supportive and safe space.

## üìö Workshops & mentorship support during the program
Mentors will introduce key concepts and methodologies in the sprint relevant to the development of the project, as well as provide feedback to project teams throughout the 6 sprints. Topics include agile workflow, project management, project architecture, UX design, pitch design, critique/feedback sessions and other project-related tech topics.
 
## üèóÔ∏è Develop project management and team-building skills
Teams are not expected to deliver a fully running solution with all features implemented, but to deliver an MVP solution. To facilitate successful project completion, project teams receive mentorship on project management and team-building topics from the very beginning. 
 
## üíª Hands-on client management experience
Experience all the rewards and challenges of working with real people as your project clients/ product owners and real-life project needs. Teams will have a biweekly feedback session with POs to ensure project requirements are met. 
 
## üìñ Learning and collaborative approach
Fostering collaboration between participants during deploy(impact), is highly important to women++. As 3 teams will be working towards solving the same project, collective sessions to share learnings and different approaches to a solution will be promoted. This will allow teams to learn from each other and keep their focus on learning rather than "winning" the final prize. During the award ceremony, there will be a prize for the best solution per project and a prize for team learning voted by the teams themselves.
